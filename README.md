# EndeavourOS Setup
A simple repository for my setup script, done as a backup for myself.

To run the setup script, just run the "endeavouros-first-setup.sh" script in your shell and terminal of choice.
### Note: not every user and their hardware will work with this script. Do not use it as a baseline for your system.
