# EndeavourOS Setup
A simple repository for my setup script, done as a backup for myself.
As it can be observed in the script and the name of the repository, this is for the Arch-based Linux distribution "EndeavourOS", my personal Linux system of choice. This script was made as a way to make setting up my system, if in a case of emergency, will only take a short amount of time.

To run the setup script, just run the "endeavouros-first-setup.sh" script in your shell and terminal of choice.

### Note: not every user and their hardware will work with this script. Do not use it as a baseline for your system, as it can cause complications for you, make your workflow more difficult, or create unnecessary complexity and abbreviation from the original usage and setup of your system.

## Final Note: this script works with every Arch-based distribution, but requires you to set up an AUR helper of choice all by your own, if not using EndeavourOS as your distribution of choice. A script for such a case was made as well to simplify the process for both me, and possibly others, to set up an individual Arch system as quick as possible.
