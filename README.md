# EndeavourOS Setup
A simple repository for my setup script, done as a backup for myself.
As it can be observed in the script and the name of the repository, this is for the Arch-based Linux distribution "EndeavourOS", my personal Linux system of choice. This script was made as a way to make setting up my system, if in a case of emergency, will only take a short amount of time.

To run the setup script, just run the "endeavouros-first-setup.sh" script in your shell and terminal of choice.
### Note: not every user and their hardware will work with this script. Do not use it as a baseline for your system.
